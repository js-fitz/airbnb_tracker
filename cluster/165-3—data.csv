There is a nice large park in the backyard, which makes for less neighbors.<br />The bus stop is just a few minutes walk, and the bus lines can bring you pretty quickly to either the red line or the orange line of the T. The bed is comfy and the rooms get good natural light. The place is clean and the host is friendly. There are usually other guests to get to know. Good for young professionals and graduate students.",2020-09-01
