Youâ€™ll love my place because of the high ceilings, the coziness, the light, and the location. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers. This is the perfect location to start the freedom trail. Other than a queen bed and a twin XL bed, there is space for 2 more people on a couch that becomes a bed.",2020-08-31
