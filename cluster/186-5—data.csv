Lovely Victorian-era  houses with large bay windows, balconies, and gingerbread decoration, are interspersed among marching triple-deckers from the 1920's on the hillsides.   St Margaret's hospital used to stand at the top of our hill, so most of the people you meet here still work in a medical field.   We are only 15 minutes from Savin Hill beach, and one stop away on the subway is the more extensive Carson Beach and the pretty and walkable UMass/JFK peninsula.  Nearby restaurants include McKenna's Cafe (great breakfast!), Shanti Indian restaurant (several times Best of Boston award!), and the Harp and Bard (fun Irish pub).  Our area includes a historic burial ground, the historic Strand Theatre, and the oldest house in Boston (still inhabited!)","Charming sunny private suite with private kitchen and bathroom in historic house near subway in safe area, only 15 minutes to financial center of Boston.
