Ours is a historic neighborhood, all of Back Bay is built upon moist wooden pilings, typical circa 1890. Buildings are brick, several stories, built as single family homes at the turn of the century, nowadays are converted to condos. Non-concierge type buildings, usually owner occupied. I always notice some architectural detail of interest when walking, always something new!  Winding staircases, architectural details in woodwork,windows, small gardens, iron gates, and entrances. Close to several UNIVERSITIES, (BU, Northeastern, Emmanuel, MIT, MIT, Harvard Medical School, and Harvard main campus just across the River), and several HOSPITALS (Dana Farber, Childrens, Longwood, Beth Israel Deaconess). We are located in Back Bay/Charlesgate/Kenmore area, and a 2 minute walk to Kenmore Green Subways and bus shuttles.","Sabbaticals-Medical Rotations. LOCATION!
