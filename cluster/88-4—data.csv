The neighborhood is home to many fine restaurants, cafes, galleries, shops, and bars. It is very walkable and ideal for sightseeing at many attractions. There are eleven parks nearby, perfect for a relaxing after dinner stroll.<br />Despite becoming very gentrified in the past 30 years, the location has a rich history of attracting diverse groups of people. The neighborhood was originally built in 1849 on tidal marshes to divert the cityâ€™s population from the crowded downtown and Beacon Hill neighborhoods. The first waves of residents included new immigrants residing in rooming houses (more likely than not, our house was one!), followed by a burgeoning middle class that included business owners and bankers. In the 1920s, settlement houses were being built as a way for the city to bring people of different socio-economic classes ","Charming room on the 3rd floor in a classic Boston brownstone in a historic district. Walk everywhere and just 3 minutes by foot to the subway! Built in 1875, it is one of the few homes in the area that has not had its spirit diminished by complete gut renovation. There is soul (i.e. lots of stairs, settling, thin walls, and interesting quirks) here!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Your room is located in a nineteenth century Victorian four-story row house which sits amid America's oldest and largest intact Victorian neighborhood. Despite being in a premier location, we are far from fancy! If you are expecting granite countertops, stainless-steel perfection, and exquisite furnishing, you will need to look elsewhere. We aim to achieve a comfortable and homey bed and breakfast while staying true to our objective that travel should be accessible to a wide range of people.<br /><br />The room is on the 3rd floor, faces rear of the house with a great view of some of the Boston skyline.
