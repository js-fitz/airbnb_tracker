You'll also be close to the T so you can get practically anywhere.  Jamaica Plain is right around the corner - a diverse assortment of restaurants can be found there, as well as a Whole Foods if you'd rather stay in and cook.  The renowned Sam Adams brewery is only 2 stops away by T.","Freshly renovated first floor studio apartment with new floors, fresh surfaces everywhere, efficiency kitchen and bath.  Queen bed sleeps two, Ikea foldout couch has space for one more, or two snugglers.  7 min walk to T - just 3 stops from Back Bay, 6 to downtown!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The kitchen has a two burner cooktop, microwave, toaster oven and coffee maker. The refrigerator is a below-the-counter variety. If you're looking to throw dinner parties or bake cakes, it's probably not what you're looking for. But if you need a basic, clean kitchen to prepare meals as an alternative to exploring the city's culinary scene, it's quite sufficient.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />There is a washer and dryer in the basement of the building that you are able to share with the other occupants of the building.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />Three night minimum starting mid-March (St Patrick day), though two night stays might be accommodated - feel free to inquire.<",2020-09-01
