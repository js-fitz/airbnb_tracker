This is not a hotel. There is no breakfast. This is a modest & cozy place in a prime location in the heart of Boston. You cannot beat this location. We worked extremely hard to secure this location. It is not fancy. it's an old brownstone building but it has its charm. It only has the bare necessities. People love it because it is practical and functional. U",2020-09-01
