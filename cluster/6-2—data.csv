9018434,Warm & Cozy Home for Your Stay!,6-2,15583990,Natalia,,,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9018434,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/15583990,1.0,387420,Active,11 Lonsdale ST 16 2 Dorchester MA 02124,Dorchester's Ashmont neighborhood is growing rapidly but still maintains its small-neighborhood charm. There are amazing local restaurants around every corner and the train is very easy into downtown and Cambridge.,"My beautiful home is just steps from Historic Peabody Square in the Ashmont neighborhood of Dorchester. It's a quick 15 minute ride to downtown by car or train, or you can stay local and enjoy what the neighborhood has to offer!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />I'm Colombian so my cultural presence can definitely be felt! I'm also an avid traveler so the d√©cor will tell the story!<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Enjoy your morning coffee on the porch! <br /><br />My cozy apartment has two floors, each with two bedrooms. The kitchen and bathroom are newly remodeled and updated. <br />There is an open living space with a TV featuring Netflix, HBO, and Showtime. <br /><br />I live on the first floor so I am very accessible to your every need!<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />My house was built in 1915, which means it has creaky stairs, only one bathroom, but truly spacious bedrooms. The heating system is new, and the kitchen/bath were updated when I moved in in 2015.<br /><",2020-09-01
