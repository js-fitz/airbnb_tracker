Can you find our Minion?<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Due to Boston's new and very restrictive short-term rental law, starting Sep 1, 2019, we have switched to renting units for only a minimum of 32 days (because 28 days is the cap set by Boston and 31 days is the cap set by Massachusetts).

Anyway, please do stay with us if you need 32 or more days. <br /><br />With the above note, if you boo",2020-09-01
