3294152,"Garden Suite near subway, beach",186-2,9898255,Jessica,,,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3294152,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/9898255,91.0,404467,Expired,,"Jones Hill is a quiet, safe residential neighborhood with a rich history and many examples of classic New England architecture.  There is a mix of 1860's-1890's mansions and triple deckers from the 1920s.  It borders South Boston and is within walking distance of two beaches as well as some nice biking paths; the historic Kennedy Library museum is nearby.  We are at the top of the hill, so you can see the ocean from the yard, and we get ocean breezes all summer.  My house was built in 1880 for the daughter of the farmer that owned the hill, and though the neighborhood is part of Boston, it still has a suburban feeling, with giant trees and plenty of yards.  In past decades it has become home to immigrants as well as old New England families; about half the arrivals were from Ireland, but also some from Italy, Eastern Europe, Vietnam, the Carribean and Cape Verde.  In winter we help eachother with shoveling snow; people stay a long time, as it is a pleasant place to live.","Delicously cool one-bedroom suite with private galley kitchen, private bathroom and living room, opens onto large deck, giant trees and hillside garden; charming Victorian hill-top house. Quiet residential neighborhood,  fast walk to subway station, four stops to historic and financial center.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />You enter via a new deck with table and chairs and a gas grille; the deck is shady, and overlooks the back garden and hillside.
