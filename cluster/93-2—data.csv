It is a gorgeous place for a walk on a nice day! We are also within walking distance to the Arnold Arboretum and a 5 minute drive to the Franklin Park Zoo!  There are shops and restaurants at the bottom of our street (2 minute walk).","Our home is very new for Boston - built in 2011. The first level is open concept with plenty of space for cooking, eating, watching tv and hanging out! There is a master upstairs with a master bath,  a room with a bunk bed and another with a queen. We are steps from the Forest Hills train station (Orange Line, Commuter Rail, and busses), we have a garage, and the house is set up for kids!<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />During the summer, my husband may be working/home, so he will be staying in the basement suite which has a guest bedroom and half bath. He'll need to use the guest bathroom upstairs for showers but is not around often or will be working outside, etc.  Otherwise, guests will have access to the full main living space and upstairs with 3 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, as well as the garage. During February and Spring, no one will be at home.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />We have a crib, mattress and linens that can be set up in any room for $60/stay.<br /><br />",2020-08-31
