Those visiting Boston often begin by taking an Old-Town Trolley Tour. This hop-on-hop-off bus tour travels throughout our storied city, offering guests the opportunity to stop in Beacon Hill, Fenway Park, Harvard University, along the Seaport or elsewhere in our city. It’s a great way to take in the scope of our city, while exploring as much as you wish. Boston transportation is visitor-friendly. Buses, water ferries and the subway, known as the T, make it easy, quick and affordable to visit various parts of the city.
