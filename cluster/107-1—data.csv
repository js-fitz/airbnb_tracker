It is very close to Harvard, MIT, Boston University by bus, biking, or walking. There are plenty of bars/restaurants where you can go to.","Great location. Close to schools. Ideal for an international student or researcher. Quiet. New bathroom (shared). Friendly cat. Welcoming host. Long term preferred.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Quiet street of Allston, while very close to the city life. The house is not a typical home stay, it is rather a comfortable and VERY QUIET lodging house where everyone is nice and friendly and busy with their lives. I make sure you feel comfortable to my best ability. Since I am not available to answer questions regularly, I wrote small notes with indications where is what and reminders of some sort, just so everyone meet their expectations.<br />Please recycle everything, please don't mix it with food. Please inform host if you plan to be absent some nights during your stay.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />The room is warm but there are always extra blankets. Also, if you need different pillow, if mattress is too soft or too hard, just ask, I will help find the solution.<br />Microwave",2020-09-01
