Most mansions on Sumner Hill were built in the immediate after-math of the Civil War, although some predate the war.  The neighborhood was the home of many activists who fought against slavery and for the vote for former slaves and for women, as well as against the slaughter of Armenians before World War I.  The Loring Greenough House, a museum that served as a hospital during the Civil War, is just around the corner from us, and is open for tours.  Historic tours of the neighborhood are also available through that museum.","Tall arched windows on east and south, stunning antique furniture, private bath with mosaic floor and antique soaking tub.
