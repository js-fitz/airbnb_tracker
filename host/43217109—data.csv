There is a convenient MBTA Silver Line bus stop right on front of the building.  The Silver Line bus is the only bus line that can take you to the airport.  The unit is also at walking distance (15 mins) from Massachussetts Avenue Orange Line and Back Bay Subway Station.  So, bring your walking shoes.  Boston has a great bicycle network.  It is the best way to move around.  Check out the The Hubway.  You can rent a bicycle to move around and to get to your destinations easily.  I totally recommend biking than walking.<br /><br />The City of Boston also has a great bicycle sharing program (thehubway.com) where you can use a bicycle for a short period of time, a month or a year.  It is very convenient.  It is basically the version of a zipcar but with a bicycle.  There is a station with bicycles ready to be rented a block away from the building.","Condominium with Patio, walking distance to Copley, Back Bay Station, Whole Foods and access to Mass Pike.
